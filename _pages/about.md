Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Abdellah EL MEKKI, a researcher who studies how computers can understand and work with human languages. I have a PhD from Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco.

## Current Work

I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at MBZUAI in the UAE. My main research is on creating and studying large language models that can work with many different languages with a focus on under-represented and morphologically rich languages .

## What I Do

I'm a computer scientist who focuses on:

- Making language technology work for all languages, especially those with fewer resources
- Creating AI that everyone can use, like voice assistants and large language models
- Building these tools efficiently, so they can work even where computing power is limited

I call myself a computational linguist because I combine computer methods with traditional language study techniques.

## My Interests

I'm fascinated by:

- How machine learning can help us understand language
- The way people interact with language technology
- Making language AI that's inclusive and easy to use
