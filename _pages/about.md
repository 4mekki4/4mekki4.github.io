Hello! 👋 I'm Abdellah EL MEKKI, a machine learning engineer 👨‍💻 and PhD student 🎓 at the [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University](https://www.um6p.ma), Morocco 🇲🇦. I mainly focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🗣️ for low-resource languages 🌐 and multilingual NLP 🌍. But what does a machine learning engineer specializing in NLP do? 🤔 In essence, I'm a computer scientist 👨‍🔬 who uses various methodologies 🔬 to study, analyze, and model human languages 📚, always striving to meet two main goals 🎯: 1) develop accessible AI 🤖 for all world communities 🌎, starting with voice assistants 🗣️ and extending to large models 🖥️, and 2) build these models with minimal resources 🔄, to ensure access even in low-resource environments.

I refer to myself as a computational linguist, because I use computational methods in tandem with traditional linguistic techniques in my work. In addition, I explore the interaction between humans and language technology systems, looking into how people build, support, engage with, and relate to these systems. As an NLP professional, my work is characterized by a keen interest in the intersection of machine learning, computational linguistics, and software engineering, with an emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility.
