Abstract: This paper deals with driver identification and fingerprinting and its application for enhanced driver profiling and car security in connected cars. We introduce a new driver identification model based on collected data from smartphone sensors, and/or the OBD-II protocol, using convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks (long short-term memory) RNN/LSTM. Unlike the existing works, we use a cross-validation technique that provides reproducible results when applied on unseen realistic data. We also studied the robustness of the model to sensor data anomalies. The obtained results show that our model accuracy remains acceptable even when the rate of the anomalies increases substantially. Finally, the proposed model was tested on different datasets and implemented in Automotive Grade Linux Framework, as a real-time anti-theft and the driver profiling system.
